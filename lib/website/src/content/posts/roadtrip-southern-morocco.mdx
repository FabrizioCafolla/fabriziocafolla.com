## From the dunes of the Sahara to the waves of the ocean

Southern Morocco is a land of extraordinary contrasts, where the landscape changes rapidly: from the Atlas Mountains, through vast valleys and gorges, to the magnificent dunes of the Sahara, to the relaxing beaches of the ocean.

It’s a deep dive into the most authentic nature and a fascinating culture. Each city offers unique culinary specialties, and time seems to have stood still in each village. These are places ready to tell wonderful stories.

## Road trip

The itinerary includes the stops we covered over approximately ten days, starting in Marrakech and ending in Essaouira. We traversed the vibrant heart of Morocco on a journey of discovery.

> At the end of this article, you’ll find the full itinerary on Wanderlog, with recommendations for cities, restaurants, and other must-see attractions.

We (my girlfriend and I) planned the tour to suit our needs, choosing each stop and the length of each stay. For the first part, up to the coast, we relied on an experienced guide (I can provide contact information if you’re interested) to arrange our accommodations and transportation. The guide was invaluable for two reasons: he helped us discover extraordinary places along the way, and he introduced us to Moroccan culture, sharing stories and fascinating insights.

### ✈️ Marrakech: The Red City and its enchanting chaos

Marrakech is a whirlwind of sensations where you can dive in fearlessly and be swept away by the tastes, smells, markets, and vibrant energy of the people who fill its streets. It’s chaos that somehow transforms into harmony as soon as you step through the doors of the riad, surreal oases of beauty that leave you speechless.

- **Local Cuisine**: You’ll find a wide range of culinary options, from street food to sophisticated restaurants. Try traditional delicacies such as Baghrir (Moroccan pancakes) or B’stilla (a savory-sweet cake).
- **Must-do experiences**: Don’t miss getting lost in the winding streets of the medina, exploring the markets and artisan workshops. Take time to visit the mosques and other landmarks.
- **By night**: Although I didn’t experience Marrakech’s nightlife firsthand, the city offers plenty of entertainment options, with venues that combine music and art.
- **Coworking**: There are plenty of quiet places to work, both in the medina and in the newer part of the city, for those who need a quiet workspace.

### 📍Valley of Roses: A blooming, hidden oasis

From the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, head to the tranquil Valley of Roses with a stop in Kalaat M’Gouna. It’s a long journey, but along the way, you’ll encounter breathtaking scenery perfect for a relaxing break, from the majestic Atlas Mountains to valleys filled with blooming roses.

- **Local Cuisine**: Here, you can enjoy authentic local cuisine, with dishes prepared mainly from fresh, local ingredients.
- **Must-do experiences**: There are many trekking options, or you can visit the cooperatives to buy handmade products directly from the artisans.
- **By night**: There isn’t much nightlife here, but that’s part of the charm. It’s a peaceful place where you can relax and enjoy the peace and quiet.

### 📍Sahara Desert: A night in the dunes

Heading south, the landscape changes dramatically, from mountains to the boundless expanse of the Sahara. Merzouga is the most popular gateway to the desert — a small town perfect for overnight stays and the starting point for exciting Saharan excursions with experienced guides. Alternatively, you can stay in desert villages; I’ve included details of the camp we stayed in on the trek log, a stunning place that leaves you speechless.

- **Local Cuisine**: In this region, you’ll find traditional Berber dishes with bold, spicy flavors.
- **Must-do experiences**: Classic activities include camel rides, quad biking in the desert, or, for the more adventurous, the thrill of snowboarding down the towering dunes.
- **By night**: In the villages, you can spend the evening enjoying traditional Berber songs and dances, but the real show is the starry sky above you as you relax in the deep silence of the desert.

### 📍Ouarzazate: Hollywood of the desert

Ouarzazate is best known for its film studios and the historic Ait Ben Haddou Kasbah, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s an ideal stopover either on the way back to Marrakech or for those heading to the coast.

- **Must-do experiences:** Be sure to visit the village of Ait Ben Haddou.

### 📍Taghazout: Surf and relax

After the desert, we head to the coast, to a small town called Taghazout, about 20 km from Agadir, but with a lively, unique atmosphere. For years, this place has been a paradise for surfing enthusiasts and those seeking a relaxed lifestyle. It attracts cultures from all over the world, creating a vibrant atmosphere full of parties and fun. There are plenty of hostels and surf camps to stay in. It’s a 5–6 hour drive from Ouarzazate, but well worth it.

- **Local cuisine**: You’ll find delicious fresh fish and excellent local produce.
- **Must-do experiences**: Visit Paradise Valley, go surfing, or, if you’re a beginner, take lessons (there are many shops offering instructors and equipment).
- **By night**: You’ll find plenty of places to drink (including alcohol) and listen to music. However, the nightlife here is very different from that in Europe or the US, so don’t expect the same scene, but it’s still fun in its way.
- **Coworking**: Compared to previous stops, you’ll find several cafes with dedicated workspaces for a quiet working environment, though the spaces are small and availability may be limited.

### 📍Essaouira: Pearl of the Atlantic

A trip to southern Morocco wouldn’t be complete without a stop in Essaouira, a coastal town with stunning colonial architecture. Its rich history is full of incredible events that have made it one of Morocco’s most cosmopolitan cities.

- **Local cuisine**: Fresh fish in every style imaginable. Another specialty here is honey and Amlou (a creamy spread made with almonds and Argan oil, similar to peanut butter).
- **Must-do experiences**: Walking along the ocean, but especially getting lost in the city’s charming streets and artisan shops (much less chaotic than Marrakech, with no motorbikes or smog).
- **By night**: Essaouira has a very open and lively nightlife, reminiscent of European cities. You’ll find bars for drinks and music venues that resemble small clubs.
- **Coworking**: There are many options, from cafes to fully equipped coworking spaces.

### 🏁 Marrakech: The Return

Morocco has many airports, but direct flights to and from Italy usually depart from Casablanca or Marrakech. From Essaouira, the closest airport is in Marrakech, about 2.5 to 3 hours away.

> Marrakech airport is chaos!

I’m not kidding — it’s a place where you can wait in passport control lines for two or three hours (speaking from experience), both coming in and going out. On the return trip, I highly recommend arriving at least three hours before your flight, as boarding passes can only be issued at the airport check-in. Departure security is generally quicker than arrival but still quite slow.

## Tips and fun facts for your road trip in Southern Morocco

- **Cuisine**: Moroccan culinary tradition is rich and varies from region to region. Mint tea is by far the most common drink and is usually offered upon check-in at riads. Tajine is a must-try dish found everywhere, made with vegetables and meat, usually lamb, chicken, or beef, and cooked with a blend of spices, especially cumin. As for sweets, Morocco offers a wide variety of desserts, so you’re sure to find something you love.
- **Guides**: To get the most out of your trip, I recommend hiring a guide to handle your riad bookings and transportation into the desert (or beyond). With the right guide, you’ll experience hidden gems without having to worry about the logistics.
- **Argan**: The argan tree is unique in that its fruits grow only in a specific area of southwestern Morocco. The fruits are used to make argan oil, a versatile product used as a condiment (or in recipes like Amlou) as well as in natural cosmetics. Often, the collection and refinement of argan oil is managed by women’s cooperatives that open their shops for tours and direct sales.
- **Driving and getting around**: I didn’t rent a car, but from all the miles we traveled, I can tell you that there are many police checkpoints, complete with radar speed checks (often unmarked). Be sure to obey the speed limits. City driving can be chaotic, but it’s manageable, and the major highways are generally quiet. There are no trains in the south; buses are available, and along the coast, the souk2surf.com shuttle service is a convenient option that can be booked online.
- **eSIM**: If possible, I highly recommend using an eSIM instead of a local SIM card. You can activate it before your trip so you’re connected as soon as you land. It’s easy to reload, requires no SIM card removal (just disable your regular SIM to avoid unwanted charges), and creates no waste since there’s no physical SIM to discard afterward. The downside is that it costs about 30% more than a standard SIM.
- **Download offline maps**: Even if you have Internet access, download offline maps from Google Maps or use Organic Maps. This will ensure that you’ll be able to navigate safely and get to your destination.
- **Water and Alcohol**: As you may know, Morocco is a Muslim country, which means that alcohol is restricted. You’ll only find it in certain tourist areas or certain places. Always drink bottled water instead of tap water, and avoid cocktails with ice as much as possible.
