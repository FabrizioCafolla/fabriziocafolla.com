Travelling in Sardinia is a unique and awesome experience that changes you inside every time.

Yes, it's true, there are millions of articles about Sardinia, but what interests me is to give you my point of view, to share with you some of the places I visited. I hope you can find some interesting ideas for your own trip.

Below you will find a road trip that will immerse you in the wonderful Sardinian culture and its wildest nature.

## Road trip

The road trip starts in Alghero and ends in Olbia, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the north of Sardinia. Of course, it depends on how many days you stay and your means of transportation, but what you need to know is that the two main airports in northern Sardinia are Alghero and Olbia, and from there you can reach beautiful destinations in a short time.

If you want all the details, I have created a map on [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/view/wuyujnggiq/roadtrip-north-sardinia/shared) that includes all the beaches, towns, restaurants, and much more. Here in this article, you will find a selection of the most beautiful and interesting places to visit and stay.

### Alghero

A wonderful city with an ancient soul overlooking the sea and its beautiful Bastioni. The airport is fifteen minutes from the center, the city is people-friendly, the historic center is small and not far from Alghero’s most famous beach, Maria Pia.

From Alghero, if you have a car (spoiler: it’s essential when traveling in Sardinia!), it’s a strategic point that allows you to reach many places.

In the heart of northeastern Sardinia, Olbia is a fascinating meeting point between past and present.

## Useful tips

- **Rent the car** (or camper, motorcycle): It's not advisable to visit Sardinia without your transportation. You can only reach the most beautiful beaches with a vehicle, and public transport doesn't guarantee access to the best places.
- **Boat experience**: I highly recommend taking boat trips to experience the beauty of the Sardinian sea fully. Many companies across the island offer a variety of options. Be sure to book in advance if you're traveling in July or August.
- **Download offline maps**: Even if you have Internet access, download offline maps from Google Maps or use Organic Maps. This will ensure that you can navigate safely and reach your destination.
