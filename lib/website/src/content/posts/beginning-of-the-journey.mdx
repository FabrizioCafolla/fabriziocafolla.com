## A New Adventure as a Digital Nomad

From today, I begin a new adventure. It has been a while since I wanted to put down in black and white a fundamental part of my life that I care a lot about.

I have always enjoyed sharing the tech side of my work, and I will continue to do so, but now I feel the need to also share the human aspect behind everything.

Since last year, I have fallen under the definition of a **digital nomad** (although I prefer just **nomad**) as I have effectively begun to travel and work while staying away from home for entire months.

Sharing and dialogue with me are a fundamental aspect of life, like work, in which I have always given importance by explaining and making my projects (and those of the entire Italian tech ecosystem with the Italia Open-Source community) accessible. Now, however, I would like to share what I know about travel, specifically, travel as a digital nomad.

Yes, I know you’re thinking _“another one”_ and it’s true, there are many who talk about it and are much more experienced than me, but firstly this is a project that stimulates me and so I do it for myself. Secondly, I want to share my experiences and not only, hope that they can help someone and ignite a spark or start a dialogue that enriches everyone.

## What you will find in the On the Road column

The name is obvious, right, I know! But it comes from a book that when I read for the first time changed my life, **On the Road** is a novel by Jack Kerouac in which he narrates a part of his life made of trips from one coast to the other of America knowing, exploring, immersing himself in life.

But so, when will I start and where will I share? but above all what will I share?

Let’s start with **what**. What I will do will simply be to share:

> 1. Tools, resources, and best practices to travel safely and in full immersion

> 2. How to plan road trips and advice on the places visited

> 3. My experiences and those of other digital nomads with food for thought

When I don’t have an answer now, but, I will publish whenever I have something interesting to say.

Finally, for **where** I initially thought of writing articles on my blog, in the future we will see.

To **whom** is it addressed? It is aimed at everyone who wants to take inspiration, who is a beginner, who is an expert in creating a dialogue, who wants advice on destinations and useful resources, but above all who wants to travel enjoying the nature and culture of each place.

> I don’t pretend to teach anything, I just want to share and start a dialogue.

## Pack your backpack

This first article is just a small introduction to what the column will be, a column that will adapt, and evolve both in form and content.

So sit back and pack your backpack to leave, as new articles and new adventures will arrive. I will talk about slow travel, how to reconcile work and travel, programming and randomness, and much more.

Thank you for getting this far, see you in the next article 💚
